        <h2>HERE IS THE LIST OF THE ASSIGNMENTS I CREATED THIS SEMESTER IN WEB-BASED ART 2025 ENJOY</h2>

        <p>
            This Page was our very First Index Page. It was created using the W3Schools videos.
            <a href="firstpage.html">PAGE:ONE</a>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            This second page was created using the guided tutorials the instructor put out during the lecture. We
            learned how to reference other pages and create hyperlinks to webpages.
            <a href="psyche-launch.html">PAGE:TWO</a>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            This is the image that we were required to embed into the code so that it showed up on the page when
            opened. <img src="psyche-launch2023.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: auto; z-index: 2">

            It is a short children's story about a boy who finds a key stashed away in his backyard.
